    <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.</h3>
    <p>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! The next 12 weeks was the best – and most grueling – time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

    <p>I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.</p>

    <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.</h3>
    <p>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.</p>

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

        “Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.  
        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn  
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former  
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.  

        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very  
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.  

        The agile team project in particular was outstanding. It took my  
        learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.  

        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after  
        receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
